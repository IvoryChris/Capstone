            <p>My passion for technology started young when I first built and coded robots with Lego Mindstorms in the FIRST Lego League. That hands-on experience sparked my curiosity and laid the groundwork for my love of problem-solving, creativity, and innovation through technology.</p>
            <p>Over time, my interests have expanded to web development, digital marketing, design, and editing. I enjoy creating visually compelling projects, building intuitive websites, and exploring how strategy and creativity intersect in the digital world.</p>
            <p>I’m currently pursuing my degree, set to graduate in May 2025, and am actively growing my skills to prepare for a dynamic career in tech. Whether it’s developing user-friendly websites, contributing to IT solutions, or crafting unique digital marketing campaigns, I’m driven to make an impact in this ever-evolving field.</p>
            <p>Beyond technology, I’m also a passionate cellist and a lover of orchestral music—bringing a creative and thoughtful approach to everything I do.</p>
            <p>This portfolio showcases my journey, skills, and projects as I carve out my place in the tech world. Let’s build something amazing together!</p>
