                <h2>High School</h2>
                <p>I'm a Senior at Rock University High School (RUHS), graduating in June 2025.</p>
                <p>I am the first two-term student body president and one of only 13 AVID-certified tutors at RUHS. Additionally, I'm proud to be the first RUHS student to join the Leadership Development Academy of Rock County. My team, the Power of 7, consists of seven strangers working together to benefit the YWCA CARE House's revitalization efforts.</p>
                <p>Through these leadership roles—whether as a student body president, a tutor in the AVID program, or a member of the Leadership Development Academy—I've developed crucial skills in collaboration, problem-solving, and community engagement. These experiences have taught me how to lead with purpose and work effectively with others to bring about meaningful change.</p>
                <p>RUHS's unique structure divides my education into two phases: the first three years focused on building a strong academic foundation in traditional subjects, while my senior year is centered around leadership development and college readiness. Through dual-enrollment courses at Blackhawk Technical College (BTC), I'm gaining valuable college-level experience that complements my leadership growth and helps prepare me for success after graduation.</p>

                <h2>College</h2>
                <p>I'm also in my final semester at Blackhawk Technical College (BTC), graduating in May 2025. I'm a proud member of the Beta Rho Psi chapter of Phi Theta Kappa and a multi-semester President's list recipient.</p>
                <p>During the summer of 2024, I had the opportunity to serve as the Blackhawk Tech IT intern through the Rock Internship Program. In this role, I assisted in the campus-wide transition to Windows 11 and managed the setup and relocation of IT equipment for the new Public Safety building, providing hands-on experience in IT systems management.</p>
                <p>Through my coursework and practical experiences, I've gained proficiency in web development, particularly HTML and CSS, which I consider my strongest skills. I am also highly proficient in JavaScript, GitHub, and frameworks like Bootstrap, allowing me to build dynamic, responsive websites.</p>
                <p>While I have a solid foundation in front-end development, I'm still eager to deepen my knowledge in advanced front-end technologies and mobile app development and expand into programming beyond web development. I'm excited to continue learning, as I'm passionate about technology and its potential to solve real-world problems.</p>
