                    <h3>My Tech & Leadership Beginnings</h3>
                    <p>
                        My journey into coding started early, with LEGO robots in the 3rd grade. What began as building and programming these robots quickly evolved into a passion for tech. Around the same time, I discovered leadership when I became involved in student council in 5th grade. I quickly realized that I loved not just building robots, but also helping others build their potential.

                    <p>
                        In middle school, I merged my love for tech and leadership by becoming a short-term LEGO robotics mentor for younger students. That was when I realized how much I enjoyed sharing knowledge and seeing others grow. During this time, I also joined D.A.R.E., participated in writing competitions like Delta Kappa Gamma, and discovered my love for photography.

                    <h3>Stepping Up My Game</h3>
                    <p>
                        High school marked a big turning point. I served as the class rep for both my freshman and sophomore years and was elected President of the student body for two terms. It was during this time I got more serious about coding — starting with block coding and moving into languages like Python and C# for gaming scripts. I also began modding games like GTA V, which pushed my coding knowledge even further. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        But I wasn't just focused on academics. I led initiatives, represented students, and connected with the community. By the end of my sophomore year, I had the chance to earn an associate degree alongside my high school diploma — an opportunity I jumped at.

                    <p>
                        Fast forward to today, where I'm about to graduate with an associate degree a month before my high school diploma. At the same time, I hold several leadership positions, including two terms as the President of RUHS, serving as a student representative on the governing board, being an AVID tutor, and even taking part in the Leadership Development Academy of Rock County. These roles have given me valuable skills in team leadership, decision-making, and community engagement.

                    <p>
                        Now, as I near graduation, I see all my interests — tech, leadership, and creativity — merging into a future where I can combine these skills to create meaningful change. I've learned that the best way to lead is to care about others and work alongside them, whether it's building websites, organizing events, or solving problems with new tech.
